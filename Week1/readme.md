### Lectures
When we give lectures, we will often have text editors and will be demonstrating commands and techniques you can use to become and awesome developer.

### All thing things a basic trooper needs!

#### CLI (Command Line Interface)
> Commands are awesome! There are so many, ou will never learn them all. But you will often use a common subset of commands. Here they are below

BASH (Born Again SHell) Commands!

Most commands have a `--help` flag, which will give gerneral help on how to use that particular command.

You can press TAB to autocomplete your commands!

- `~` a VARIABLE for your `home directory`
- `cd` change directory
- `pwd` print working directory
- `ls` list files
- `ls -a` list ALL files (including hidden files, any file starting with a DOT [.] called DOTFILES, these are hidden by default)
- `ls -l` list files vertically
- `mkdir` make a directory
- `rmdir` remove (empty) directories
- `touch` make a file
- `rm` removes files
- `man` manual, look up any command (press q to quit)
- `nano` a CLI text editor
- `cat` concatinate, or spit out, the files contents of a file
- `clear` clear the STDOUT (standard output) currently on the terminal
- `reset` completely clearout your terminal session, as if you logged again

> Control+C is often the defecto way to escape from command line limbo

### Super Basic git commands
When ever you see `(master)` on the commanline, you are in a git repo.

- `git status` show the current status of the repository you are in
